Welcome to MovieRatingSystem, a robust web application built for movie and TV show enthusiasts using ASP.NET Core 8.0 with C#. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for a clean separation of concerns and scalability. Data persistence is managed by Entity Framework Core, utilizing a relational database to store user details, media data, ratings, and user lists. It employs a repository pattern with services like MediaService and UserActionService to encapsulate business logic, enhancing modularity and testability. Key features include user authentication via ASP.NET Identity, role-based authorization (e.g., Admin role), and dynamic content management. The admin panel supports adding and deleting media, while users can manage watchlists and favorites. The architecture is structured with Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers for maintainability.
